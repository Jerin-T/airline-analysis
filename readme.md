Airline-Analysis by Group 5 

# Airline Analysis Overview

## Description

The project is based on the valuable data of US airlines which includes various flights operators, flown flights, various airports, regarding the number of delays and cancellations. Here, we are analyzing various aspects of the dataset to get a proper understanding on how to minimize airline issues and provide a better outcome. From the analysis of the data, On the analysis of the dataset, we found that delay, cancellations, and diversion are the main challenges and cause serious resource wastages that leads to performance issues in the domestic airlines industry. We also understood the common pattern of airports, airlines and seasons that are usually delayed. Weather, airline issues and air traffic in each entity are the primary cause of this. By addressing these issues by identifying the patterns from historic data we could minimize the root cause of the issues and enhance the industry performance to a great extent. We are using various tools and techniques to conduct analysis and visualization, including Spark for data processing, Tableau for creating meaningful visualizations, GCP for cloud-based resources, and Hadoop for distributed data storage and processing. The project outcome aims to lead to more informed decision-making, enabling the airline industry to proactively manage challenges and optimize resources by properly handling the issues related to delays, cancellations, and diversions can potentially result in improved on-time performance, enhanced customer satisfaction, and cost savings.

## Introduction

The aviation industry plays a crucial role in global transportation, connecting people and goods across the world. This analysis delves into airline data to uncover meaningful insights that can shed light on the industry's trends and challenges.

## Data Sources

The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset sourced from reliable aviation databases, including:
- [Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](https://www.bts.gov/)

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the airline industry:
- **Flight Trends:** Analyzing historical flight data to identify seasonal patterns, busiest travel periods, and route popularity.
- **Route Optimization:** Investigating the efficiency of different flight routes and suggesting potential optimizations.
- **Delays and Cancellations:** Examining factors contributing to flight delays and cancellations and their impact on airline operations.

## Key Findings

Some of the key findings from the analysis include:
- Summer and winter months experience the highest travel demand, with a significant increase in flights during holiday seasons.
- Certain flight routes exhibit higher utilization rates, suggesting opportunities for increased frequency or improved scheduling.
- Weather conditions and air traffic control issues are major contributors to flight delays, highlighting the importance of proactive management.

## Visualizations

The repository includes a collection of visualizations that help illustrate the insights gained from the analysis. These visualizations include:
- Line charts showcasing monthly flight trends
- Pie charts depicting Airline travel distribution
- Bar graphs indicating the primary causes of flight delays and cancellations

## Methodology

The analysis employs a combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and data visualization techniques to derive meaningful conclusions from the raw data.

## Tools Used

The analysis was conducted using various tools and technologies, including:
- Python programming language
- Google Cloud
- Tableau
